## Do your part ‚Äî participate in the community

**Communities keep software projects alive.** Without them, projects usually fade
into obscurity when the primary developer loses interest or becomes busy in
other parts of their life. That's where you come in! You can:

- Read through the [issues] and give a <g-emoji alias="+1" class="emoji" fallback-src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44d.png" ios-version="6.0">üëç</g-emoji> to the ones you care about most.
- Open [new issues] with feedback, feature requests, or bug reports.

## Looking for co-maintainers

Coolor is still maintained, and I have no plans to change that. I would actually like to do more development and get Coloor feature-complete. However, it is hard for me to get motivated to do that when I'm the only developer projects I'm involved in that *do* have others working on them).

If you're interested in becoming a co-maintainer, I'm willing to spend time walking you through the code base.

## Screenshots

Screenshots are slightly out of date.
